My placement in the ORPALIS company ended my two-years degree in computer science at the University Institute of Technology of Blagnac. It started on the 8\up{th} of April and finished on the 14\up{th} of June 2013. The topic of my placement was to create a regression testing application for a barcode recognition engine developed by the company. The ORPALIS team needed to have a global vision of the engine efficiency by observing the evolution of the recognition rate with the new versions of the software. I worked in a Microsoft environment, that's why i used the Integrated Development Environment Visual Studio 2012 and the C\# language. Understanding the .NET Framework and the Windows Operating System permitted me to develop an efficient easy-to-use software.

Once this project achieved, i completed my knowledge in the .NET development by creating a second application: a virtual barcode reader. This consumer software had to be as simple as the real wired barcode readers.

These two projects allowed me to discover small team working and made me change my professional goals. Indeed, i feel ready to continue studying computer science in engineering school in order to develop my skills in software engineering.
